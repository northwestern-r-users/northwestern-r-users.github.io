Our March meeting was pushed to April due to construction in the library over spring break.  

Friederike Hoeg was our first brave volunteer to tell us a little about herself, what she works on, and how she uses R in her work.  She clued us in to the [directlabels](https://github.com/tdhock/directlabels) package for adding labels directly to R plots.  

[Richard Paquin Morel](https://sites.northwestern.edu/paquinmorel/) was our main presenter.  He taught us about doing network analysis in R with the igraph and statnet packages, including which package is best for different tasks.  He covered the full workflow from importing data, to subsetting graphs, to visualizing them.  [Materials from Richard's presentation](https://github.com/ramorel/grad-school/blob/master/R/network_analysis_in_R_md.md), including links to more resources, are available on GitHub.

If you'd like to volunteer to present in a future meeting, please email Christina at [christina.maimone@northwestern.edu](mailto:christina.maimone@northwestern.edu).
