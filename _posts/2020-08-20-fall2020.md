The Northwestern R User Group is looking for new leadership to plan events and schedule speakers.  

If you  would like to take a leadership role in the group, please contact [Christina Maimone](mailto:christina.maimone@northwestern.edu).

No events are currently planned for Fall 2020.  

Please see Northwestern IT Research Computing Services for R (and other) **[workshops](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/training.html)**, and **[consultation services](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/consultation/data-services.html)** for help with R code.
