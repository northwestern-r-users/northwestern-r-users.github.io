[Collin Erikson](https://sites.northwestern.edu/collin/) showed us how to use the `microbenchmark` and `profvis` packages to time our code and identify bottlenecks. He also gave some good advice on when and when not to bother with trying to speed up code.  His [slides]({{ site.baseurl }}resources/TimingCode.html) and [R markdown]({{ site.baseurl }}resources/TimingCode.Rmd) files are available.

Christina Maimone recapped the RStudio Conference.  [Slides]({{ site.baseurl }}resources/rstudioconference/index.html) are available.   Links to conference videos and slide decks are available at [ https://github.com/simecek/RStudioConf2018Slides]( https://github.com/simecek/RStudioConf2018Slides).
