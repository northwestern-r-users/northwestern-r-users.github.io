R-Ladies Chicago is hosting a September meeting on the Evanston campus, in Mudd 2210.  Thursday, September 26th, 4:30pm.

## Planning Future Meetings

This will be the third year for the R User group.  To keep the group going, we need additional organizers!  If you are willing to 1) present at a monthly meeting, 2) take responsibility for planning the content and/or finding a speaker for a monthly meeting, or 3) being part of the organizing committee, please contact [Christina Maimone](mailto:christina.maimone@northwestern.edu).  Without additional involvement, we won't be able to keep the group going.


## Get Involved!

If you have ideas for meeting topics or presenters (including yourself), or would like to take a leadership role in the group, please contact [Christina Maimone](mailto:christina.maimone@northwestern.edu).
