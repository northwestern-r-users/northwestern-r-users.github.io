This group welcomes members of the Northwestern University community using, or interested in using, the [R statistical computing environment](https://www.r-project.org/).  All experience levels are welcome.  

Our [monthly meetings](/events.html) will include group members presenting on different R features, packages, analysis projects, mini-workshops, and other awesome things you can do with R.  We'll also have time to share information with each other and work together to solve problems.  

Meetings will be on the Evanston campus.  There is a [Chicago R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRUG/) that may be of particular interest to those downtown.

Note that the group won't be teaching members how to use R.  If you're looking to learn R or improve your skills, and you're a student, faculty, or staff at Northwestern, Research Computing offers access to DataCamp online, interactive tutorials.  [Apply for access](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/campus-events/data-camp.html).
