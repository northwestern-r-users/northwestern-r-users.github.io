# Upcoming Events

* Thursday, 03 May 2018, 3:30pm, Evanston Campus, Mudd Hall Room 2210: 
Mini hackathon! Recreate (or improve) an existing data visualization.  Bring your laptop and work either by yourself or in a group.  Don’t have a laptop?  That’s ok — you can always work with others!  

We’ll have datasets and visualizations available to work on, but if there’s a specific plot you’d like to recreate, or data you want to work with, feel free to bring your own projects too.  After 45-60 minutes of coding, we’ll share what we’ve made (or where we got stuck) to learn from each other.  

* Wednesday, 06 June 2018, 3:30pm, Evanston Campus, Mudd Hall Room 2210; topic TBD

The group will be taking a break after June for the summer, but we'll resume in the fall.  There will be multiple R workshops available over the summer.
